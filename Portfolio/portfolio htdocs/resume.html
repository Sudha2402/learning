            <h3>Shanaya Bazaar </h3>
            -- An Ecommerce Company
            <!-- <p><strong>Description:</strong> A brief overview of the project.</p> -->
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Phenoxi Shanaya Bazaar is an e-commerce website built to earn the trust of all age groups. I created this platform for selling products online using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I also integrated a database using MySQL. This dynamic website was developed to learn how to serve customers digitally. Canva was used for designing posters.

The main objective of the project is to provide others with a well-built, dynamic website that allows sellers to rent out their products instead of storing them and losing trend appeal. I believe that renting dresses is a great option for customers to reinvent their look for every occasion at just Rs. 100 plus delivery charges.

This platform can be beneficial for sellers because many e-commerce companies charge taxes and delivery fees even after products are returned, leaving sellers with no benefit.

In a country like India, people are very skilled at taking advantage of customer service. Many buy a product, use it for six days, and return it citing quality issues—simply because they don’t want to reuse the same item. Nowadays, no one wants to wear the same dress on different festivals.

Keeping all this in mind, I found a solution that helps both sellers and customers: affordable product rentals. Currently, rental costs in the market are very high, and rental clothes often lack proper cleanliness and hygiene, smelling unpleasant. Because of this, most people prefer to buy new clothes rather than rent, which leads to environmental waste.

I believe rental products should be hygienic before being offered to customers; this will improve customer perception and help protect the environment.

I am eager to continue developing my project and am dedicated to shifting public perspectives on renting. The experience I gain during this internship will be instrumental to its success. My goal is to minimize resource waste caused by overproduction, ensuring products are accessible and valued instead of being neglected. To achieve this, the project needs strategic marketing and a committed team to maintain the highest hygiene standards for reusable products.</p>
