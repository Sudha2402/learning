            <!-- <h3>Project Title</h3> -->
            <h3>Shanaya Bazaar </h3>
            -- An Ecommerce Company
            <!-- <p><strong>Description:</strong> A brief overview of the project.</p> -->
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Phenoxi Shanaya Bazaar is an ecommerce wesite that builts the trust of all
                age group.I made this E-commerce website which is used for selling products online. I have used HTML,
                CSS,javascript and php . I have also integrated the database using mySQL. I have mad this dynamic
                website to learn about how we can serve digitally. I have used canva for designing the posters.
                The main objective of the project to to let others get a free well build dynamic website that let
                sellers to sell their product on rent instead of putting into the store and loosing the trend. I believe
                giving dresses on rent is good option to let the customer use it to give themself a new look on every
                occasion at just cost of Rs100 + delivery.

                I find this helpful for sellers because many E-commerce companies charges including tax + delivery from
                the sellers even after when product is returned. Sellers are getting no banefit.

                As in a country like India, people know very well how to take advantages of customers service. There are
                many people who buy the product use it for 6 days and return it by raising the question of quality. They
                do this because they don't want to reuse the same thing again.
                Nowaday , noone wants to repeat the same dress on different festivals.

                Keeping all this in mind , I found a solution to help both sellers in loss and customers trending style
                by selling products at rent at affordable cost . In market rental cost is very high and they don't
                maintain the cleaniness and hygience and cloths are smelly too . hence noone buy cloths at rent and they
                prefer to buy new and it causes many waste in the environment.

                I believe , rental products should be made hygienic before giving it to any customer which helps to
                improve both customer perception and environment health.

                I'm eager to continue developing my project and dedicated to shifting public perspectives. The
                experience I gain during this internship will be instrumental in its success. My goal is to minimize
                resource waste from overproduction, ensuring that products are readily accessible and valued by users
                instead of being neglected. To achieve this, the project requires strategic marketing and a committed
                team to maintain the highest hygiene standards of reusable products.</p>
